                <h2 class="card-title">Introduction to Eldoret</h2>
                <p>Eldoret, the fifth-largest city in Kenya and the capital of Uasin Gishu County, stands as a beacon of progress in the North Rift region. Located at an altitude of 2,100 meters above sea level, this vibrant city serves as the economic, educational, and cultural hub of Western Kenya. With a population exceeding 400,000 residents, Eldoret has transformed from a modest farming settlement to a modern urban center.</p>
                <p>The city's strategic location along the Great North Road connecting Kenya to Uganda, combined with its moderate climate and fertile soils, has positioned it as a prime destination for investment and settlement. Eldoret's nickname, "City of Champions," is well-earned, having produced more world-class athletes per capita than any other city in the world. Beyond sports, it serves as Kenya's agricultural breadbasket and a major educational center.</p>
                <p>Eldoret International Airport, one of Kenya's busiest domestic airports, connects the region to national and international destinations, while the city's growing industrial sector continues to attract both local and foreign investors seeking opportunities in agro-processing, manufacturing, and service industries.</p>

                    <i class="fas fa-landmark"></i>
                </div>
                <h2 class="card-title">Historical Development</h2>
                <p>Eldoret's history dates back to 1910 when 60 South African families, part of a larger group of settlers from South Africa, established the first European settlement in the area. The name "Eldoret" originates from the Maasai word "eldore" meaning "stony river," a reference to the Sosiani River that flows through the city center. The river's stony bed provided natural crossing points that determined the initial settlement patterns.</p>
                <p>The arrival of the Uganda Railway in 1924 marked a turning point in Eldoret's development. The railway transformed the settlement from a remote farming community into a vital trading post. Goods from the surrounding agricultural hinterland could now be transported efficiently to Nairobi and Mombasa, stimulating economic growth and attracting more settlers.</p>
                <p>Eldoret was officially gazetted as a township in 1928 and later as a municipality in 1961. Post-independence, the city experienced rapid growth as the Kenyan government invested in infrastructure and institutions. The establishment of Moi University in 1984 as Kenya's second public university further accelerated development, transforming Eldoret into a major educational center.</p>
                <p>The 1990s saw Eldoret emerge as a center for athletics excellence, with world-class training facilities attracting athletes from across the globe. The city's elevation, temperate climate, and extensive network of dirt roads provided ideal conditions for high-altitude training, cementing its reputation as the world's running capital.</p>

                </div>
                <h2 class="card-title">Economic Landscape</h2>
                <p>Eldoret's economy rests on three strong pillars: agriculture, education, and athletics. As the heart of Kenya's grain basket, the surrounding Uasin Gishu County produces approximately 25% of Kenya's wheat and significant quantities of maize, dairy products, and horticultural crops. Large-scale commercial farms coexist with smallholder producers, creating a diverse agricultural sector.</p>
                <p>The city hosts East Africa's largest milk processing plant, Brookside Dairy, which processes over 1.5 million liters of milk daily from across the region. Other major industries include flour milling at Eldoret Flour Mills, textile manufacturing at Raymond's Woolen Mills, and various agro-processing enterprises. The Eldoret-based Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) plays a crucial role in the national dairy sector.</p>
                <p>Education represents another economic cornerstone, with Moi University serving as the region's largest employer after the government. The university, with over 50,000 students, has spawned numerous private colleges, research institutions, and student-related businesses. Other notable institutions include the University of Eldoret, Eldoret Technical Training Institute, and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, which serves as a regional healthcare hub.</p>
                <p>Recent years have seen growth in the service sector, with major banks, insurance companies, and retail chains establishing regional headquarters in Eldoret. The city's strategic location along the Northern Corridor transport route positions it as a key logistics and distribution center for goods moving between Kenya and landlocked neighboring countries.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">Athletics Capital of the World</h2>
                <p>Eldoret's reputation as the "City of Champions" is undisputed. The high-altitude training grounds of Iten (just outside Eldoret) and surrounding areas have produced an extraordinary concentration of world-record holders, Olympic champions, and marathon winners. The region's athletes have collectively won more Olympic medals than most countries, with notable champions including Eliud Kipchoge (marathon world record holder), David Rudisha (800m world record holder), and Vivian Cheruiyot (multiple world champion).</p>
                <p>The unique combination of altitude (2,100-2,400 meters), moderate climate, and extensive network of soft-surface running trails creates ideal training conditions. International athletes from Europe, America, and Asia regularly visit Eldoret for training camps, contributing to a vibrant athletics tourism economy. Local training camps like the High Altitude Training Centre and individual athlete camps host hundreds of professional runners year-round.</p>
                <p>Major athletic facilities include the Kipchoge Keino Stadium (capacity 30,000), named after Kenya's first Olympic gold medalist, and numerous world-class training tracks. The city hosts several annual athletic events including the Discovery Kenya Cross Country, Eldoret City Marathon, and various international championships. These events attract thousands of spectators and generate significant economic activity.</p>
                <p>The athletics culture extends beyond elite athletes, with running deeply embedded in local lifestyle. School competitions are fiercely contested, and community running events draw participation from all age groups. This pervasive running culture has made Eldoret not just a producer of champions but a living testament to human athletic potential.</p>

The Eldoret International Airport, upgraded to international status in 2012, handles both passenger and cargo flights, with direct connections to Nairobi, Mombasa, and regional destinations. The airport plays a crucial role in transporting fresh agricultural produce to international markets and supporting the growing athletics tourism industry.</p>
                <p>The city's road network has seen significant improvement with the tarmacking of major arteries and the ongoing expansion of the Eldoret Bypass, which diverts through-traffic away from the city center. Public transportation is served by matatus (minibuses) and boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis), with plans underway for a more organized public transit system.</p>
                <p>Healthcare infrastructure is anchored by the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), one of Kenya's largest public hospitals and a teaching hospital for Moi University's medical school. The hospital serves as a referral center for the entire Western Kenya region, offering specialized services in various medical fields. Numerous private hospitals and clinics complement the public healthcare system.</p>
                <p>Educational infrastructure continues to expand, with new campuses, research facilities, and student hostels being constructed regularly. The city's utilities have kept pace with growth, with reliable water supply from the Chebara Dam, expanding electricity coverage, and growing internet connectivity supporting both residential and commercial needs.</p>
